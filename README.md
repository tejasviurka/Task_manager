# Task_manager

## Application Overview

**Task Manager** is a web-based application designed to help users efficiently manage their daily tasks. Built with React, it provides a clean and user-friendly interface to add, view, search, and manage tasks. This application is ideal for users who want to stay organized and keep track of their to-do items in a simple yet effective way.

### Key Features & Functionality

- **Add Tasks**: Users can easily add new tasks by typing in the task name and clicking the "Add Task" button.
  
- **View Tasks**: All tasks are displayed in a list format with task names and status, allowing users to quickly see what tasks are pending.

- **Search Tasks**: A search bar allows users to filter tasks by name, helping them quickly locate specific tasks from the list.

- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list once they are completed or no longer needed.

- **Task Persistence**: The tasks are stored locally, so they persist even after the page reloads, providing a seamless experience across sessions.

- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Technologies Used:
- React
- CSS (with custom styling)
- JavaScript/TypeScript

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back! This command removes the build dependency and gives you full control over configuration files.
