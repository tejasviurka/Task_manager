# Task_manager
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back! This command removes the build dependency and gives you full control over configuration files.
